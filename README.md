# AtlasIO

This repository a number of tools to read in and manipulate Atlas files. The primary code is written in the Julia programming language, but it can be used in Python as well.

## Atlas files
    
Atlas files contain a collection of map assignments. The format is a specialization of the JSONL format. Each line in an Atlas file is a JSON object. THe first three lines describe the particular Atlas. Starting with the fourth line, each line is a JSON object that describes a map assignment. More information can be found in the [Atlas format](atlas_format.md) file.

## The files contained here are : 
    * AtlasIO
        - Atlas.py
            This is the main Atlas reader Library 
    * AtlasExamples
        - atlas_nc_multiscale.jsonl.gz
            This is a large collection of map assignments for testing. Notice that it is compressed. The library can read compressed or uncompressed files.
        - atlas_truncated_nc_multiscale.jsonl
            This is part of a real Atlas file for testing. It is uncompressed. 
        - test.jsonl
            This is a small hand made collection of map assignments for testing. 
    * test.jsonl.gz
        This is a small hand made collection of map assignments for testing.
        Notice that it is compressed. The library can read compressed or uncompressed files.

    * truncated_nc_multiscale.jsonl
        This is part of a real Atlas file for testing. It is uncompressed. 
        This file is stored in a multi-scale format which keeps counties whole if they are all assigned to the same district. 

    * pct21_20cen_wMCD.json, pct21_20cen_wMCD_updated.json
        This contains some election data and the adjacency data. The second files as some more recent election data

    * helper_functions.py 
        Some helper functions that are useful.

    * example_atlas.py
        this is an example file reading in some single scale maps

    * example_atlas_multilevel_loadMaps.py
        this is an example file reading in some multi-scale maps

    * example_atlas_multilevel_precinctHistogram.py
        An example reading in a multi-scale assignment. These multi-scale assignments come from code which try to preserve the different levels.

    * example_atlas_multilevel_precinctOutcomes.py
        this is an example 
    
    * atlas_measureID12.jsonl.gz
        Big ensembles used in NC 2021 court case.
        They are multi-scale and big. Path to ensembleâ€™s atlas in original repos is :
